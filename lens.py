# Demonstrating the usefulness of point-transfer-matrices in analyzing lens designs.
#
# The lens here is a photographic Cooke triplet, design adapted from https://wp.optics.arizona.edu/jsasian/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2016/03/L20_OPTI517_Cooke_triplet.pdf

#  The first and third elements are LAK9 glass (n=1.69) and the 2nd element is SF5 (n=1.67) (From Schott, Î» = 588nm)

# Let's break the system into parts to make things simpler.  First, the ray transfer matrix of each element.

# If we assume the aperture stop is immediately before the 2nd element and has a radius of 5mm, the pupils may be located by imaging the edge of the AS forward and backward through the system.
