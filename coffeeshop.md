# Coffeeshop samples
Some examples of varying quality built using [`ganja.js`](https://github.com/enkimute/ganja.js`) in the [coffeeshop](https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/examples/coffeeshop.html)

## Using GA to build things:
* [A clock built with epicycles](https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/examples/coffeeshop.html#x3bt4MaVY)
* [A water molecule](https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/examples/coffeeshop.html#nDi5ME9dx) highlighting its structural symmetries
* [A crystal lattice in 2D](https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/examples/coffeeshop.html#l76_nNqS7), WIP that will be used to demonstrate Bragg scattering
* Simple quasicrystals built using the slice-and-project method from a higher dimensional space, in [1D](https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/examples/coffeeshop.html#2HAwZ7EKV) and 
[2D](https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/examples/coffeeshop.html#nDiQPMDY5)

## Optics demonstrations
* [Thin lens imaging](https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/examples/coffeeshop.html#0-8AuklW7) using the classic "ray tracing with pencil and straight-edge" method.  GA is used to build algebraic expressions like "draw a line parallel to the axis" or "draw a line through the focal point".
* [Wireframe of a gaussian laser beam](https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/examples/coffeeshop.html#eIo6FSr7t) built using Arnaud's representation of the beam as a line complex.
